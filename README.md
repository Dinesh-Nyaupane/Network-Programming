This Java program demonstrates how to work with InetAddress to get information about a random host (from a predefined list of websites). Here's a brief breakdown of the program:

Host List: The program defines an array of popular websites.
Random Host Selection: It picks a random website from the list using Random.

Fetching Host Info:

The program uses InetAddress.getByName() to resolve the selected website's IP address.
It prints the host name, IP address, and canonical host name of the selected site.
Local Host Info: It also fetches and prints the IP address of the local machine using InetAddress.getLocalHost().
IPv4 or IPv6: Based on the length of the byte array returned by getAddress(), it checks if the address is IPv4 (4 bytes) or IPv6 (16 bytes).
Error Handling: If the host cannot be resolved, it catches the UnknownHostException and prints an error message.
The output will show details about the random website and the local machine's IP, along with whether the website address is IPv4 or IPv6.
